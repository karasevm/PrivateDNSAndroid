## Installation

### IzzyOnDroid (Recommended, will enable auto-updates on Android 12+)

1. Install an F-droid client such as [Droidify](https://droidify.eu.org/download) or the [official F-Droid client](https://f-droid.org/)
2. Verify that [IzzyOnDroid repo](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=3BF0D6ABFEAE2F401707B6D966BE743BF0EEE49C2561B9BA39073711F628937A) is added and enabled

### GitHub Releases
Get the latest apk on the [releases page](https://github.com/karasevm/PrivateDNSAndroid/releases/latest) 

## Activation
To change the system DNS options the app requires `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission. There are multiple ways to provide it.

### Automatic (Shizuku)
1. Install and start [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).
2. Start the app and allow Shizuku access when prompted.

### Manual
For the app to work properly you'll need to provide it permissions via ADB:

1. Get to your PC and download platform tools from google [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
2. Extract the tools, and open terminal in the same directory ([Windows guide](https://youtu.be/6vVFmOcIADg?t=38), [macos guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/210147/how-to-open-terminal-in-the-current-os-x-finder-location/)).
3. Turn on USB Debugging on your phone (This may require different steps, for Xiaomi you also have to enable `USB Debugging (Security settings)`, but generally [this video guide](https://youtu.be/Ucs34BkfPB0?t=29) should work on most phones)
4. Connect your phone to your PC
5. Run this command in the terminal

```
./adb shell pm grant ru.karasevm.privatednstoggle android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

6. That's it, you should have the app installed.
